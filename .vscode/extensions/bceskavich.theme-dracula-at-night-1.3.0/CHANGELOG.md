# Changelog

## 1.3.0

Updates to React and JSX stylings:

- Component tags are colored purple to help differentiate between HTML tags
- Ensure fat-arrow function definitions on component classes as an auto-binding work around are styled green as expected

Better GraphQL support:

- Please use [GraphQL for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kumar-harsh.graphql-for-vscode) to get the extended style scopes that power this update!

Also:

- Remove default behavior to highlight matching brackets as pink. This is often unhelpful, especially when the brackets are already colored pink (e.g. Interpolation, JSX escapes). Matching bracket colors can be set manaully in user settings.

## 1.2.0

Updates to better support Ruby:

- Colors for instance (orange) and class (cyan) variables
- Fix a bug with coloring function invocations
- Ensure function definition punctuation is not colored green
- Ensure block method params are colored orange as expected
- Separator punctuation (like dots) should be styled pink
- Style constants as cyan to help differentiate with symbols, which are purple
